**Package name:** Portable ANalytical data Aggregation and Coordination
for database Entry and Access (panacea)

This package is currently a concept. See also the ISC proposal: [https://github.com/FAIReLABS/isc-proposal-panacea].

Panacea is aimed at making data streams in e.g. analytical laboratory 
settings more transparent and easily accessible. This is needed as 
closed sourced vendor-supplied software for analytical instruments often 
act as black boxes, thereby inhibiting access to raw data and 
full-disclosure of critical processing and transformations. 

Panacea would constitute at it most fundamental level a parser for text based
data in poorly structured formats (e.g. non-tabular). It detects variable, 
value, and, optionally, units triplets.

Ultimately, panacea could help establish fully integrated laboratories with 
centralised data management. Hence this solution contributes to the FAIR[1] 
guiding principles for data, thereby stimulating innovation, and inclusiveness 
through open science.
